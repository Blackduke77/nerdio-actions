## üöÄ Suggested Use Cases

- After resizing an Azure VM OS disk.
- After adding a larger data disk to a VM.
- During the auto-scaling process for session hosts.
- As part of a post-provisioning step for VM builds.

## üß† Important Notes

- The partition must already exist. This script does **not** create new partitions.
- If the partition already uses all available space, the script will detect and skip extension safely.
- Always ensure a VM reboot is scheduled if other partition-related scripts are run afterwards.
